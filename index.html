				<span class="big">
					As you might already know, today is my last working day here at Acquire BPO. I was hired by JC Transfiguracion on May 02, 2011 as the 4th member of Special Projects and I would like to tell you all that being a member of this team is one of the best things that's ever happened to me. It gave me the opportunity to work with different departments and meet a lot of amazing people.

					I would like to give my special thanks to...
				</span>
			</div>

			<div class="scrollbar">
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Ms. Flara</span>, for being so nice to me and for being so tolerant on my shortcomings as a programmer. You even scolded Allan Cortez because of a mistake I made (I’m so sorry Sir Allan). 
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Allan</span>, thanks for all the support in all of the projects we’ve worked together. You often got scolded because of me, I’m so sorry. 
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Ephraim</span>, for being so makulit and funny ^_^
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">DJ</span>, my very first client when you were still the overlord of Saveology. Thanks for my very first project and thanks for the laugh. Please continue to give everyone something to laugh at whenever they need it.

				<!-- <span class="extra-big">
					My teammates:
				</span> -->
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Jobel</span>, for being so nice to me, for supporting me and for filling in the things that I lack as a programmer. I’m going to miss you.
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Dar-c</span>, for being such a nice friend. I did a lot of mistakes with my projects but you are so tolerant and considerate. Thanks ^_^
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Kennidy</span>, commute na lang tayo. Mas OK na matraffic ng 2 hours kesa 3 weeks. Thank you, sabi mo nga hindi lang tayo officemate, tropa tayo ^_^
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Regie</span>, thanks for not criticising my codes. You’ve already seen how I write codes, but you have the decency not to criticise any of it. Thank you.
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Jolo</span>, please learn GIT. You’ll benefit from it, believe me. Also, please learn how to use Classes. Ang old school, yung hindi gumagamit ng Classes. Object-oriented po tayo dapat, saka ang ID or PK dapat dynamic hindi dapat nag-aadjust ng template dahil nagbago ang ID sa database. Lastly, please step-up. Seriously. 
				</span>
			</div>

			<div class="source">
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Sir Raymund</span>, thanks po kasi kahit madalas palpak ako, hindi niyo ako pinapagalitan. You remained supportive pa rin. Thanks po talaga sir.
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Sir OJ</span>, you’re one of the brightest persons I’ve worked with. I believe I will regret not being part of this team when the Tamang Panahon came to you guys. I know this team will flourish even more. Although I will no longer be part of it, I will be really proud. Thanks a lot.
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="big">
					<span class="blue-color">Dana</span>, for putting up a hidden team called Special Projects with JC and Migs. Without your vision and stubbornness, I don’t know if I would be as good as I am today. I grew rapidly here at Acquire and I am extremely grateful to you and the whole company as well.
